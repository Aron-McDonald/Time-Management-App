How to compile and run the application

Step 1

Open the TimeMgmt Folder.

Step 2

Once inside the TimeMgmt folder, double click (open) the TimeMgmt solution (TimeMgmt.sln) file, which will open in your visual studio and compile the applications classes and code.

Step 3 (Optional)

This step is optional as the application should automatically create the database on your machine when it is executed.

Now that all the classes and source code is within your visual studio, navigate to the Tools dropdown menu on the top of visual studio's interface, click on NuGet Package Manager then click Package Manager Console. A window at the bottom of Visual Studio's interface should open. Once this window is open change the default project from TimeMgmt to TimeMgmtLibrary by clicking on the Default project dropdown menu and selecting TimeMgmtLibrary. In Package Manager Console type 'update-database' after the 'PM>' tag and then press enter. This should create the SQL database for the TimeMgmt application on your local machine.

Step 4

Now the application is ready. To Run/execute the application click on the green start button at the top of the screen. OR Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + F5) to run the application.
